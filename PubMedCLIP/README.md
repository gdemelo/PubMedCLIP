# PubMedCLIP 
Source code for reproducing PubMedCLIP by fine-tuning CLIP using image--text pairs extracted from PubMed articles as provided in the ROCO dataset.
<br>
The fine-tuned PubMedCLIP models with ViT32, RN50 and RN50x4 visual encoders are also provided on [GDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nCU_3PxQ-thitS76mmJ3W8RergPsN961?usp=sharing).

## How to use
This project requires Python 3.7 or newer.
1. Download ROCO dataset from [the official repository](https://github.com/razorx89/roco-dataset),
2. Create your virtual environment, activate it and install ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```,
3. Set the input paths in `run.sh`,
4. Run `run.sh`.
